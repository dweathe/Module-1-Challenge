Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results (README.md)
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The project overview is to help a beginning playwrite, Louise, determine how to create a crowdsourcing campaign to fund her new play, Fever.  She has estimated a budget and she has turned to us, Excel Master users to help her set up the best campaign for her play.

### Purpose
The purpose of our work is to provide data analytics that will support her budget.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analyses performed were as follows.  For Deliverable 1, I analyzed the relationship between outcomes and launch month by creating a pivot table from the Kickstarter Worksheet "Parent Category" and "Years" data.  The outcomes were specifically canceled, failed and successful. "Years" were filtered into months to give the visual representation of a line chart that showed which months were best to launch comparable plays; or plays that Louise liked.  For Deliverable 2, I visualized the data to best represent, successful, failed and canceled plays based on the funding amounts. I created a line chart that clearly showed the percentage successful and failed related to the goal-range amounts.  The canceled percentage was not represented in the chart.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
